# Goal
The goal of this project was to model a 2x2x2 rubiks cube in Prolog. The algorithm should be able to randomize a cube and then solve it. A more detailed description of the different facts and rules can be found in the source code.

# Visualization of the implemented moves
Six moves were implemented to solve a randomized cube, as can be seen in the following image.
