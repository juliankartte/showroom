# WELCOME
Welcome to my github. Feel free to look around and play with the different projects. If you have questions I would love to connect with you on [linkedin](https://de.linkedin.com/in/julian-kartte-aa64a9237?trk=people-guest_people_search-card).

Please note that I only uploaded some smaller projects that I did in my free time or as a small university project in the past. These projects are not necessarily representative of my current level as a programmer. In case you want to see more up to date code please contact me to schedule a meeting where I can show you some more up to date projects related to my work as a backend engineer.

Best wishes

Julian Kartte
